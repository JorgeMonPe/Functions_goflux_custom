# Customised functions of GoFlux package
Customised function to define manual observational window with click.peak()

Two modified functions from the [goflux](https://github.com/Qepanna/goFlux?tab=readme-ov-file) package to show where the "shoulder" you added to your observational window begins. Additionally, one of them, specifically designed for analyzers that include both CO₂ and CH₄, displays both gases simultaneously, which can be useful when determining the start and end of your incubation.
